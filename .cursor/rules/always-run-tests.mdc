# Always Run Tests After Every Change

After every code change, you must:

1. Run all unit tests (e.g., with `npm test` or equivalent).
2. Run all Cypress integration tests (e.g., with `npx cypress run`).
3. If any test fails, you must fix the error and rerun the tests until all pass before proceeding with further changes.

This rule applies to all files and all types of changes.
