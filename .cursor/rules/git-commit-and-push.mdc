# Git Commit and Push Rule

When the user asks to commit to git:

1. Add all changed files using `git add .`.
2. Create a commit with a suitable and short commit message describing the change.
3. Push the commit to the remote repository (e.g., using `git push`).

This ensures all changes are tracked and synchronized with GitHub as requested by the user.
