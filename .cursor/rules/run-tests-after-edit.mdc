# Automated Testing Rule

After you make any code edit, run all tests using `npm test -- --watchAll=false`.

- If all tests pass, you may proceed with your next task.
- If there are test failures, fix the failing tests or the code causing the failures, then repeat the process until all tests pass.

This ensures that the codebase remains stable and all changes are verified by the test suite after every edit.
